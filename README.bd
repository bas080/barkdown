# Barkdown

> **EXPERIMENTAL**

Demonstrate the execution of terminal commands easily.

Instead of typing out or copy pasting the commands and their outputs you can
have barkdown do that for you.

## Usage

Take this document; it is generated using barkdown.

Simply start the line with a `$` (dollar sign) followed by a command. Let's
see what this README looks like before running it through `barkdown`.

> Prefixed with two spaces to prevent confusing the $ of the file for
  a command.

`$ sed 's/^/\  /g' < ./README.bd`
